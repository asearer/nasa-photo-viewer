        Implements a submenu for selecting image sources by date.
        Utilizes React Router for navigation between different routes.

    NasaApodComponent:
        Displays NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).
        Fetches and renders the APOD image along with its title and description.
        Supports a clickable overlay for displaying the image description.

    MarsRoverGallery:
        Displays a gallery of images captured by the Mars Curiosity Rover.
        Fetches and renders the latest Mars rover images.
        Allows users to select specific camera images for viewing.

    ApodSearch, EpicSearch, MarsSearch:
        Components for searching image sources by date.
        Fetch imagery data based on the selected date from APOD, EPIC, and Mars rover archives.
        Display fetched images along with relevant details.

    LoginPage:
        Handles user authentication by providing a login form.
        Validates user credentials and allows access to authenticated features.
        Uses a Demo account for demonstration purposes.
        
    DateSearchForm:
        Provides a reusable component for selecting a date and fetching related imagery data.
        Used by multiple components to search imagery archives by date.

Features:

    Navigation: 
    Users can navigate between different sections of the application using the navbar.

    Authentication: 
    The application supports user authentication, allowing access to authenticated features.

    Image Search: 
    Users can search for NASA imagery by date across different image sources.

    APOD Display: 
    The application displays NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day along with its details.

    Mars Rover Gallery: 
    Users can browse the latest images captured by the Mars Curiosity Rover and view them in a gallery format.

    EPIC Data: 
    Users can explore Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) data captured by NASA satellites.

External APIs:

The application leverages the following external APIs provided by NASA:

    NASA APOD API: Fetches Astronomy Picture of the Day data.
    NASA Mars Rover API: Retrieves images captured by the Mars Curiosity Rover.
    NASA EPIC API: Retrieves Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera data.

Technologies Used:

    React: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
    React Router: Library for declarative routing in React applications.
    CSS: Styling language used for UI design and layout.
    JavaScript: Programming language used for implementing application logic.

Future Enhancements:

    User Profiles: Implement user profiles to personalize the user experience.
    Favorites: Allow users to save their favorite images for quick access.
    Search Filters: Enhance search functionality with filters for better image discovery.
    Responsive Design: Optimize the application for different screen sizes and devices.
    Error Handling: Improve error handling to provide better feedback to users.

Deployment:

The application is deployed and accessible at https://asearer.github.io/nasa-photo-viewer/

User Flow: Accessing NASA Imagery and Data

    Initial Landing Page:
        Upon accessing the application, users are presented with the landing page.
        If the user is not logged in, they are prompted to log in using their credentials.
        Default credentials are provided for demonstration purposes.

    Login Process:
        Users navigate to the login page and input their credentials (username and password).
        After submitting the login form, the application verifies the credentials.

    Authenticated Home Page:
        Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to the authenticated home page.
        The home page provides navigation options and access to various features of the application.

    Exploring Image Sources by Date:
        Users can choose to explore NASA imagery from different sources based on dates.
        They select a specific date or range of dates to retrieve imagery data.
        The application fetches and displays imagery data from sources such as APOD, EPIC, or Mars rover archives.

    Viewing Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD):
        Users can access the Astronomy Picture of the Day section to view the latest APOD image.
        The application retrieves and displays the APOD image along with its title and description.

    Browsing Mars Rover Images:
        Users navigate to the Mars Curiosity Rover section to view the latest images captured by the rover.
        They can browse through a gallery of rover images and select specific images taken by different cameras.

    Interacting with EPIC Data:
        Users access the EPIC section to explore Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera data.
        They can search for EPIC imagery based on specific dates and view the captured images.

    Logout Process:
        Users have the option to log out of their account at any time.
        Upon logging out, the application clears the user's authentication status and redirects them to the login page.

Summary:

The user flow for accessing NASA imagery and data involves logging into the application, navigating through different sections to explore imagery sources by date, viewing APOD images, browsing Mars Rover images, and interacting with EPIC data. At each step, users are presented with relevant options and information to facilitate their exploration of NASA-related content.
